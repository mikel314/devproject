# Devproject

The objective of this project is to learn how to include the main data engineering tools associated with a Machine Learning project.

The code and data will be random/dummy, the idea is to build an empty shell but configure all the relevant tools and follow best practices.

In particular:

- Git and GitHub for version control
- VS Code as the development IDE
- Copilot as the AI assistant
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- Vagrant and VirtualBox as infrastructure as code to deploy the VM
- Miniconda as the Python virtual environment manager
- GitHub Pages and Jekyll with .md files for documentation
- Logging execution with loguru
- ...

All detailed project documentation is available on the repository page https://mikel314.github.io/devproject/
