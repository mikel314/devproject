# Visual Studio Code

## Introduction

There is a complete guide to VS Code that can be consulted on the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user).
It is highly recommended to visit it and read the basic tutorials. In particular, the [Get started with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started#_enhance-your-coding-with-ai-and-github-copilot), the [Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), and the one referring to virtual environments [Python environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).

The first configuration to perform is the installation of the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension to connect to the VM. The documentation on how to do this can be found in the tutorial [Remote development with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).

In these tutorials, you will be asked to install useful extensions. They can be found in the [VS Code Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace). In this project, we have used:

- [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
