# Welcome to the devproject's documentation!

This website contains the documentation for the Devproject repository. The goal is to include the main data engineering tools associated with a Machine Learning project.

The code and data will be random/dummy. The idea is to build an empty shell but configure all relevant tools and follow best practices.

It is recommended to read the following overview first and then follow the points in the index in order, starting with the block containing the essential development tools ([Git and Github](git.md), [Virtual machines](vagrant.md), [Visual Studio Code](vscode.md)).

The rest of the documentation should be relatively independent.

## Overview

The development of this project was carried out on a personal physical machine with **Windows 10**. To avoid problems with the _test&learn_ nature of this project and given the limitations of Windows as a development OS, a **Linux** virtual machine was created using **Virtualbox**.

The chosen development IDE was **VS Code**, connecting remotely to the virtual machine and to **Github** in the cloud. The following chapters describe the details of these configurations.

Although the VM could have been created manually, it was decided to use **Vagrant** as _infrastructure as code_ to learn the technology and facilitate the expected re-deployment of the VM.
