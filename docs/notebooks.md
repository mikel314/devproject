# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter (formerly IPython Notebook) is an open-source project that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a notebook. 
You need to install the python package in your conda environment with ``pip install jupyter`` and then Visual Studio Code supports working with Jupyter Notebooks natively, and through Python code files. 

The [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) tutorial is a complete guide through the main functionalities of it.

As part of the data exploration is recommendable to use some of the available extensions to visualize tables. The chosen for this project is [Data Wrangler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.datawrangler). You can learn about in the tutorial [Getting Started with Data Wrangler in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-wrangler)
